## [Learning about the fast fourier transform (25 November 2020)](./fft/fft.html)

This was a little project designed to investigate the fast fourier transform, how it works, and how to implement it to analyse audio. I'm still working on this and looking to implement it in a simple app.

## [BOIDS! (14 May 2021)](./boids/boids.html)

This was a really fun project, implementing boids in JavaScript. Still a work in progress, but it works great so far!

## [Raycaster (20 May 2021)](./raycaster/raycaster.html)

A simple implementation of a raycaster. I really enjoyed putting this together. It's amazing how simple this method is, but produces beatiful results!
